# CANalyze Hardware
Hardware for a CAN to USB device. This hardware can be used with the CANalyze
[firmware](https://github.com/kkuchera/canalyze-fw).

## Features
- USB type B and CAN DB9 connectors
- Supports both CiA DS102-2 and OBD2 type DB9 output via DIP switches
- Power via USB
- Red and green LED indicator
- This version is based on easier to handsolder SMD 0805

## TODO:
- Even smaller version without DIP switch
- MicroUSB connector
- No DB9 for CAN - just screw terminal to make PCB even smaller and easier to embed into the car permanently if needed
